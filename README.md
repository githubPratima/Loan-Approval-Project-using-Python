# Loan-Approval-Project-using-Python

The main purpose of this project is to do the analysis on the data and to decide whether the applicant is suitable for loan approval on not. Manual Process is effective, but it takes a huge amount of time for decision making when there are large number of applicants present. So, Basis on the number of criteria by analyzing different attributes of customer application( Credit History, Education, Loan Amount...) models can be used to assess the customer loan status and building future strategies such as focusing on specific customers to reach out to enhance and make loan approval process less risky.

With the help of Datamining techniques, dataset can be analyzed for preprocessing which includes extracting various information and normalizing the data and then on the basis of models and comparison of the results with high accuracy, appropriate decision can be made.
